# Tweet-Classification

Implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier which estimates where a Twitter tweet was sent from, based only on the content of the tweet itself.
The program uses a training file, estimates the needed probabilites to build a Bayesian model, and applies them to each tweet in the testing file.
